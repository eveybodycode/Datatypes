 A complex number is the sum
  of a real number and an imaginary number.
   A complex number is of the form a + ib and 
   is usually represented by z. Here both a and
    b are real numbers. The value 'a' is called 
    the real part which is denoted by Re(z), and 'b'
     is called the imaginary part Im(z). 
      Also, ib is called an imaginary number
